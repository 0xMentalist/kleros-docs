# Linguo

[Linguo](https://linguo.kleros.io/) is an easy-to-use decentralized translation Dapp allowing both translators and translation requesters to interact in a completely trustless manner. It came to light due to our own internal needs for multi-language translation of Kleros content. As it turns out, you can get quality services at a low price when calling on the decentralized free market.
