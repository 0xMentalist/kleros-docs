](https://klerosexplorer.com/case/532)  
In December 2020, the outcome of an Omen prediction market asking the following question "Will Joe Biden win the 2020 United States presidential election?" was challenged and ended up being ruled by Kleros arbitration. A lively debate occurred in social media around the validity of the market as one side argued that the final result could not be known at the time of market resolution. Case \#532 ended with a ruling in favor of the "Yes" option, settling more than $2.5M \(at the time\) of payouts.

## 3/ Case \#16/62/89 - Listing of Baer token on Ethfinex

Kleros Tokens registry was used at the time to select tokens to be listed on the Ethfinex exchange in a decentralized manner. One of the famous examples of cases originating from this decentralized listing process is the listing of Baer token. This token was rejected because the community of challenger and jurors were able to prove that the project was a scam:

* Their CTO was fake \(member of a non-existent group at Oxford University - checked with a phone call\),
* Suspicious changes to the whitepaper,
* Fake social media profiles,

Baer Chain was then classified as a Ponzi scheme by the Chinese government a few months later.
