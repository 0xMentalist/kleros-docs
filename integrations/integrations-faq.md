# Integrations FAQ

### **If I integrate with Kleros, do I need to ask my users to hold some PNK?**

Your product users do not need to interact with PNK at all. Kleros token is completely absent from your user flows and abstracted from your product interface. PNK is only needed for jurors to be drawn for jury duty and provide the dispute resolution as a service for your application.

**A useful analogy**: If your DeFi project gets its price data from Chainlink oracles, it does not mean that your users need to own LINK. The LINK token powers the service provided by the oracle middleware. Your users never see it. It is the same for PNK.

### We can't use anonymous jurors in my use case. Can we tweak Kleros in order to only select jurors from a pre-vetted pool?

At this point, it is not possible to select jurors from a pre-defined pool. Anyone having tokens can self-select to be drawn randomly as a juror. However, we understand that selecting jurors from a pre-vetted pool is important in many use cases. If this is your situation, please contact us at [contact@kleros.io](mailto:contact@kleros.io) We would like to know more about your use case.
