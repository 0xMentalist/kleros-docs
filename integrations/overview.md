# Overview

## Why do you want to integrate with Kleros services?

* If you are looking for pure **Arbitration-as-a-Service**, we can help you integrate with our core service [Kleros Court](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/court).
* If you want an oracle that can provide rulings about events, connect to [Kleros Oracle](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/oracle) and get **Truth-as-a-Service** capabilities.
* If you are searching for **Data-Curation-as-a-Service**, use our [Kleros Curate](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/curate) generalized TCR product to build open community-curated lists and read from them.
* If you want to manage crypto-vs-crypto transactions or service-vs-crypto transactions in your app, have a look at [Kleros Escrow](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/escrow) contract \(+ Widget & SDK\) for **Escrow-as-a-Service** features.
* If you are a DAO looking to fully decentralize your governance \(even the enforcement of proposal votes\), check out [Kleros Governor](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/governor) and use it as **Supreme-Court-as-a-Service**.

### What about Kleros products built on top of those services?

* Your DeFi application can source its token data directly from[ Kleros Tokens](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/tokens) registry and even curate the tokens using badges \(e.g. filtering them using preset criteria\) or indirectly through [TokenLists.org](https://tokenlists.org/token-list?url=t2crtokens.eth)
* Your product can use Sybil-resistance properties of [Proof of Humanity](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/proof-of-humanity) to protect against Sybil attacks or identify your users.
* You can apply to or benefit from decentralized translation jobs in [Linguo](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/linguo) to handle the internationalization of your products.
