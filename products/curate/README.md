# Curate

Kleros Curate is a Dapp you can use to create a token registry of just about anything using Kleros curation technology.

You just have to follow [a step by step process](https://blog.kleros.io/kleros-curate-the-explainer/) where you will be able to define the name of your list, the items that should be accepted and a number of guidelines that community members should follow in the curation process. Curate also offers [many advanced options](https://blog.kleros.io/choosing-parameters-in-kleros-curate/) which give users free reign on how to design their lists.

Once your list is up, people will be able to submit items and other users will be able to challenge them.

Using the List Browser option, you can also see lists created by other people and contribute to them by sending new items or by challenging items submitted by others.









In the digital age, whoever controls the information has the power. Big internet companies, through their internal curation services, decide which pieces of content users will see… and which they won't.

These decisions are typically made through proprietary algorithms and in-house content moderation teams.

This, in turn, creates a paradoxical situation - it is the users who generate and consume the content in platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, but they don't control the process through which information is organized and listed. It is buyers and sellers who give life to an e-commerce site like eBay, but they don't control the decision making process for accepting and rejecting item listings in the platform.

In the next generation of the internet, users will control information, and this will require a fair, transparent and community driven way to decide what is acceptable and what is not.![](https://blog.kleros.io/content/images/2020/06/FireShot-Capture-1011---jack-en-Twitter_-_Agr_---https___twitter.com_jack_status_1266390510278569984.jpg)Transparent, open source content moderation is one of the key use cases of Kleros Curate.

## A Token Curated List of Tokens <a id="a-token-curated-list-of-tokens"></a>

In March 2019, we launched the [Kleros Token Token Curated List](https://tokens.kleros.io/tokens) \(T2CR, a curated list of tokens… by tokens\).

In this early experience of community curation, any user could submit a token he wanted to be accepted into a whitelist. Other users could challenge submissions they thought didn't comply with a number guidelines regarding logo quality and smart contract address.

If a dispute happened between a submitter and a challenger on whether a token complied with the guidelines, it was solved by a Kleros jury. Tokens complying with some specific criteria were eligible for the community vote to be listed in Ethfinex and Bitfinex exchanges.![](https://blog.kleros.io/content/images/2020/06/image-1.png)The T2CR Dashboard.

The T2CR proved to be extraordinarily effective in curating a list of tokens in a decentralized way. A list where rules and enforcement were open and clear to everyone. A list to which anyone could contribute.

The list created with the T2CR contains 403 separate token listings and counting.

But why stop there? Why not use this proven technology to enable more communities to curate lists for many things? And how to democratize the use of this technology?

**Enter Kleros Curate.**
