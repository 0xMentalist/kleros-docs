# Overview

Kleros is the implementation of an arbitrator as per the [arbitration standard we developed](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/developer/erc-792-arbitration-standard). Once you integrate with the arbitration standard, you \(or your users\) will be able to choose any arbitrator that follows the standard to solve disputes, including Kleros. 

## Smart Contract Integration

You create an arbitrable smart contract as per the [arbitration standard](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/developer/erc-792-arbitration-standard) that allows parties to execute the following flow:

You can create the Arbitrable smart contract:

* From scratch by applying the [arbitration standard](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/developer/erc-792-arbitration-standard) \(and/or using our [Archon library](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/integrations/integration-tools/archon-ethereum-arbitration-standard-api)\),
* By customizing one of our [examples](https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction),
* By working with [Cooperative Kleros](mailto:contact@kleros.io) to adapt yours to the standard or creating a connector,
