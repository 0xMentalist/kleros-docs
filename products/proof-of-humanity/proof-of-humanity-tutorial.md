# Proof of Humanity Tutorial

## 1/ Register your profile \(5-10mn\)

#### 1.a/ Go to the [Proof of Humanity](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) app

* You will see the homepage of the app with the recent profiles registered in PoH.

#### 1.b/ Connect your Ethereum / Web3 wallet

* Click on the "Account" button on the top right

* In the modal that just opened, click on "Connect Account"

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29.png)

* Select the wallet you want to use \(We recommend [Metamask](https://metamask.io/faqs.html), [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) or [Authereum](https://authereum.com/welcome/)\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

* Once you have connected the wallet to the app \(the wallet will ask you to confirm the connection\), you will need to ensure you have some Ether \(ETH\) loaded in the wallet to interact with the Ethereum blockchain \(pays transaction fees\) and to be able to lock the ETH deposit needed to enter the registry \(it will be reimbursed to you\).

{% hint style="info" %}
**PRIVACY WARNING:** The Ethereum address you are using to submit your profile will be publicly linked to your identity. If you don't want your wallet holdings and transaction history to be linked to your identity, we recommend using a new Ethereum address that you seeded with funds from an exchange or from [Tornado.cash](https://tornado.cash/) 
{% endhint %}

**1.c/ Click on "Submit profile" in the top banner**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

* You will be asked to fill out the information required to submit a profile

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**COMPLIANCE WARNING:** The information you submit about your profile will be checked and verified by the community to ensure you are not a not/fake and that you complied to all the guidelines. Please read thorougly the instructions given on the submit page and check out the full [Proof of Humanity Guidelines](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/Qmc7ag5XohnSAozvsKsLCUbvaFyasyLtyi3H7g3mmxznPU/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy.pdf) to ensure the info you provide is correct.  
  
If you make a mistake in your submission \(ex: Displaying a wrong address in the video\), it could be interpreted as a malicious attack by the challengers verifying the entry into the registry and you could lose your deposit.
{% endhint %}

* Once you have filled out your Name, First Name, Last Name & Short Bio, you will be asked to upload a front-facing profile picture and a video of yourself holding the Ethereum address you used for submission and saying "I certify that I am a real human and that I am not already registered in this registry"

{% hint style="info" %}
**TIP:** Browse through "Registered" profiles \(that means they have been accepted into the registry\) to have examples of what correct profiles look like.
{% endhint %}

* At the bottom of the submit page, you will have a choice between "Self-Funding" your deposit or "Crowdfunding" it.  &gt; "Self-Fund" means you will lock the deposit yourself \(we recommend that option\).  &gt; "Crowdfund" means you want to submit your profile without paying for the deposit or only partially \(that means that your profile will be blocked in the starting phase of the validation process until someone pays the deposit for you\). Only choose this option if you are sure someone will pay for your deposit in the future.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is the Deposit?** The deposit is an amount of ETH you lock with the submission of your profile that will act as an incentive for potential challengers to prove you are a fake or bot. If your profile goes through unchallenged, you are registered and get your deposit back. If you are a fake or have given incorrect information, someone can challenge your profile and a dedicated Kleros dispute will be opened to rule on your case.
{% endhint %}

* Once you are sure all of your submission information is good \(check the [guidelines](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/Qmc7ag5XohnSAozvsKsLCUbvaFyasyLtyi3H7g3mmxznPU/proof-of-humanity-registry-policy.pdf)\), you can click on the "Submit" button. This should trigger a transaction confirmation popup in your wallet after a few seconds. Send that transaction \(ETH Deposit + blockchain fees\) and wait for it to be validated.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

* Once the transaction has been mined \(it can take a long time depending on the gas price you selected\), you should be redirected to your profile page. If you are not redirected, pelase heck that your transaction has really gone through, and if yes, check that your profile is not already submitted by clicking on "Profiles" in the top banner. You don't want to submit your profile 2 times by mistake.

## 2/ Subscribe to Profile Update Notifications \(1mn\)

In order to be notified of your profile progress in the validation process, you might want to subscribe to email notifications.

* For this, click on the "Account" button on the top right and then on the "Notifications" tab.
* There, you can check the subscription option and fill out your email address.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)

* Once you click on "Save", your wallet will ask you to sign a message to confirm \(no fee\).
* Once you have confirmed, it is done: you will now receive email updates when your profile changes status or gets challenged.

##  3/ Watch your profile go through the validation process \(**â‰ˆ** 3-5 days\)

Your submitted profile will start in "**Vouching Phase**" status and will go through a "**Pending registration**" phase before reaching the "**Registered**" status which means you are a verified human. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2829%29.png)

You can check the current status of your profile by clicking on "My profile" in the top banner \(if you're connected\) or by searching for your name in the search bar and accessing your profile.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

#### 3.a/ How to go from "Vouching Phase" to "Pending registration" status?

* You need to find one person who is in "Registered" status and that knows you in real-life \(or that can prove that you really are the person your profile describes\) and ask that person to vouch for you.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

* This person will need to go to your profile page and click on the "Vouch" button and send a transaction.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**WARNING**: Vouching for someone means you know the person and are sure that they are not fake or impersonators. You could get removed from the registry if you vouched for a bot or fake.
{% endhint %}

* Once a person has vouched for you, you will see it on your profile by checking the number of vouchers and the "Vouched by" list.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**INFO:** Vouching for someone is a benevolent act to help them get into the registry. Currently, it requires the voucher to pay for gas fees for the transaction but, soon, the vouching could be made through a simple gasless signature.
{% endhint %}

* If you have the required number of vouchers, your deposit is at 100% and you are the only current vouched profile by your voucher, then your profile will be moved to "Pending Registration" status quite soon. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why is my profile staying in "Vouching Phase"?** If you wonder why you still are not in "Pending Registration" status even though you have your deposit and vouches, it probably means the person that vouched for you has vouched for several persons at the same time. His vouches are processed sequentially and you will need to wait for the persons he vouched for before you to be validated before it is your turn for his vouch to be processed.
