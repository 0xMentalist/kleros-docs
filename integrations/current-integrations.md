# Live & Upcoming Integrations

The Kleros ecosystem lives and breathes through the disputes brought back to the Court by all arbitrable apps integrated with it. Some are developed by the Cooperative Kleros team \(cf. Products sections\) but most are external projects plugging into the Kleros products to get arbitration/curation/oracle/escrow services.

## Live Integrations

### Omen

The [Omen](https://omen.eth.link/) prediction market \(on Ethereum mainnet and xDai\):

* uses the [Kleros Oracle](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/oracle) solution \(Reality.eth \(bond escalation\) + Kleros Court \(Arbitration\)\) to rule on the outcome of events that are being predicted in their markets. For example, Kleros jurors rules on famous disputes about the number of Covid deaths in the US in July 2020 \([Case 302](https://thedailychain.com/an-important-case-for-the-decentralized-world-with-kleros/)\) and about the winner of 2020 US presidential election \([Case 532](https://twitter.com/jimmyragosa/status/1341293611682553856?lang=en)\)
* uses a [Kleros Curate](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/0xb72103eE8819F2480c25d306eEAb7c3382fBA612) list to curate "Verified Markets" that are well written according to acceptance criteria and to display a "Verified" badge next to them on their UI. It allows users to easily be reassured that they are not participating in a "tricky" market designed to fool the outcome shares buyers.

### Gnosis Safe SafeSnap

The [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) multi-sig wallet can be used for DAO governance purposes thanks to the [SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f) module. This module is using the [Kleros Oracle](https://kleros.gitbook.io/docs/products/oracle) solution \(Reality.eth \(bond escalation\) + Kleros Court \(Arbitration\)\) to effectively enforce on-chain the implementation and triggering of the proposals voted on by the DAO on Snapshot.

### CLR.fund

The [clr.fund](https://clr.fund/) public goods funding protocol uses a [Kleros Curate](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/0x2E3B10aBf091cdc53cC892A50daBDb432e220398) list to curate public goods projects that are eligible to receive donation through quadratic funding. It enables the open and fair filtering of non-public goods project that would diminish the matching of donations for compliant projects.

### Uniswap / Sushiswap

Both Uniswap and Sushiswap decentralized exchanges use [Kleros Tokens](https://tokens.kleros.io/tokens) as one of their token lists to be selected to trade on their UIs. This [token list](https://tokenlists.org/token-list?url=t2crtokens.eth) is the only one to be completely open, decentralized, and managed by the community.
