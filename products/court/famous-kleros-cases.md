## 1/ Case \#532 - 2020 US Presidential Election Omen Market

In December 2020, the outcome of an Omen prediction market asking the following question "Will Joe Biden win the 2020 United States presidential election?" was challenged and ended up being ruled by Kleros arbitration. Case \#532 ended with a ruling in favor of the "Yes" option, settling more than $2.5M \(at the time\) of payouts. A lively debate occured in social media around the validity of the market as one side argued that the final result could not be know at the time of market resolution.
